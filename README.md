# helmet-detector
An application that detects helmets by checking the tags in them.

Almost one in every four traffic violations is caused due to people not wearing helmets.So we need systems that detects helmets efficiently.But none of the available systems tackle this problem efficiently as object recognition is an AI Complete problem.

As a new idea, we can think of pattern tagged helmets that help in their identification by searching for a pattern,which is relatively easier. The available application is part of a demo and detects the presence of the pattern in a video stream.

The project was developed in Kerala Road Safety Hackathon sponsored by The World Bank, Kerala Road Safety Authority, Department of IT, International Financial Corporation with Industry partner GTECH and powered by angelhack.
